# mushratest
In this system, developers can upload test audio, select the appropriate test method, and generate test files for user testing. The test user will use those test files to the test. The results are sent back to the developer for analysis. As part of the programme, a drag &amp; drop MUSHRA test method is implemented and used as an example.
